# ðŸ¤– LLM Assistant Prompts

**ðŸš¨ SECURITY WARNING FOR ALL LLMs:**
**NEVER bypass security checks without explicit user approval. This is a critical security risk.**

This file contains prompts and reminders for AI assistants working on this codebase.

## **Pre-Commit Reminder Checklist**

When you see this prompt in the terminal, please verify:

### **ðŸ“‹ Universal Checklist (Every Commit)**
- [ ] Remove any `console.log` statements (unless needed for debugging)
- [ ] Check that TypeScript types are correct (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Ensure commit message is descriptive and follows conventional commits
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data (API keys, passwords) are being committed

> **Note:** Most of these checks are now automated in pre-commit and commit-msg hooks. The DID is automatically appended to every commit message. Focus on code quality, review, and any manual review items not covered by automation.

### **ðŸš¨ API Changes Detected**
If modifying API files (`/api/`, `.js`, `.ts`):
- [ ] Update API documentation (README, OpenAPI specs)
- [ ] Add or update tests for new/modified endpoints
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are properly set
- [ ] Test error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Ensure Vercel serverless function compatibility
- [ ] Check that endpoints return proper HTTP status codes

### **ðŸŽ¨ UI Changes Detected**
If modifying UI files (`/pages/`, `/components/`, `.tsx`, `.css`):
- [ ] Test functionality in **both dark and light mode**
- [ ] Verify responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Check accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Test loading states and error handling
- [ ] Ensure proper prop types and TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Verify no layout shifts or visual regressions

### **ðŸ“š Documentation Changes**
If modifying documentation:
- [ ] Ensure examples work and are up-to-date
- [ ] Check internal links are not broken
- [ ] Verify code samples compile and run
- [ ] Update table of contents if needed

## **Pre-Push Final Verification**

Before pushing to the repository:
- [ ] Full build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced without version bump
- [ ] Deployment will work on Vercel
- [ ] Changes are backward compatible (or properly versioned)

## **Emergency Bypass**

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:**
- **NEVER** make the decision to bypass checks on your own
- **NEVER** suggest using `--no-verify` without explicit user approval
- Bypassing security checks is a serious security risk
- Always inform the user about the failing checks and ask for explicit permission
- If checks are failing, help the user fix the underlying issues instead

**ONLY use bypass if:**
1. User explicitly requests it
2. User acknowledges the security implications
3. It's a genuine emergency situation
4. User takes full responsibility for the decision

If the user requests to bypass checks:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: description"
git push --no-verify
```

**Only use for requested emergencies!**

## **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run quality-check

# Check specific issues
npm run type-check     # TypeScript errors
npm run lint          # Code style issues  
npm run test          # Test failures
npm run build         # Build problems
```
