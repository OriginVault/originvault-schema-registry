# Multi-Root Trust Architecture

## Overview

The OriginVault schema registry supports a **multi-root trust architecture** where any entity can establish itself as a root authority for specific domains, namespaces, or concepts. This decentralized approach enables flexible trust chains that can serve various purposes while maintaining interoperability with established standards.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Decentralized Root Authority**
- Any entity can declare itself as a root authority
- No single global root - multiple specialized roots coexist
- Each root serves specific domains or purposes

### 2. **Namespace-Based Trust**
- Roots can establish authority over specific namespaces
- Clear scope definition prevents conflicts
- Cross-namespace interoperability supported

### 3. **Flexible Trust Delegation**
- Roots can delegate authority to trusted issuers
- Multi-level delegation chains supported
- Configurable delegation policies and constraints

### 4. **Standards Interoperability**
- Compatible with W3C Verifiable Credentials
- Integrates with schema.org vocabulary
- Follows cheqd DTC patterns
- Supports DIF foundation schemas

## Root Authority Types

### Namespace Roots
Establish trust for specific domains or namespaces:
```json
{
  "rootType": "namespace",
  "scope": "content-authenticity.org",
  "trustChainPurpose": "Verify content authenticity and provenance"
}
```

### Platform Roots
Govern platform-specific operations:
```json
{
  "rootType": "platform", 
  "scope": "social-media-platform",
  "trustChainPurpose": "User verification and content moderation"
}
```

### User Roots
Individual users establishing personal trust:
```json
{
  "rootType": "user",

## Trust Chain Examples

### Example 1: Content Authenticity Chain

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Content Authenticity Root] --> B[News Organization]
    A --> C[Photography Platform]
    B --> D[Individual Journalist]
    C --> E[Photographer]
    D --> F[News Article Credential]
    E --> G[Photo Authenticity Credential]
```

**Root Authority Declaration:**
```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1", "https://schemas.originvault.box/contexts/trust-chain-core.jsonld"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "RootAuthorityDeclaration"],
  "issuer": {"id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:content-auth-org"},
  "issuanceDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:cheqd:mainnet:content-auth-org",
    "rootType": "concept",
    "scope": "content-authenticity",
    "trustChainPurpose": "Verify content authenticity and combat misinformation",
    "governanceModel": {
      "type": "consortium",
      "participants": ["did:web:journalism-council.org", "did:web:photo-association.org"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Academic Credentials Chain

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Academic Accreditation Root] --> B[University System]
    A --> C[Professional Bodies]
    B --> D[Individual University]
    C --> E[Certification Authority]
    D --> F[Student Degree]
    E --> G[Professional Certification]
```

### Example 3: OriginVault Namespace Chain

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[OriginVault Namespace Root] --> B[Platform Services]
    A --> C[Third-party Integrators]
    B --> D[Content Manager]
    B --> E[Identity Service]
    C --> F[Plugin Developers]
    D --> G[Content Credentials]
    E --> H[Identity Credentials]
    F --> I[Plugin Certifications]
```

## Delegation Patterns

### Direct Delegation
Root directly delegates to trusted issuer:
```json
{
  "delegationType": "trusted-issuer",
  "trustChainContext": {
    "rootAuthority": "did:cheqd:mainnet:root-authority",
    "parentAuthority": "did:cheqd:mainnet:root-authority", 
    "chainDepth": 1
  }
}
```

### Hierarchical Delegation
Multi-level delegation through intermediaries:
```json
{
  "delegationType": "sub-root",
  "trustChainContext": {
    "rootAuthority": "did:cheqd:mainnet:root-authority",
    "parentAuthority": "did:cheqd:mainnet:regional-authority",
    "chainDepth": 2
  }
}
```

## Interoperability Mechanisms

### Cross-Root Recognition
Roots can recognize and validate credentials from other roots:
```json
{
  "interoperability": {
    "recognizedRoots": [
      "did:cheqd:mainnet:other-content-root",
      "did:web:global-journalism-council.org"
    ],
    "crossChainValidation": true,
    "federationMember": "global-content-authenticity-federation"
  }
}
```

### Federation Support
Multiple roots can join federations for broader interoperability:
- Shared trust policies
- Cross-validation protocols
- Common governance frameworks

## Governance Models

### Self-Governed
Single entity makes all decisions:
```json
{
  "governanceModel": {
    "type": "self-governed",
    "policyDocument": "https://example.com/governance-policy"
  }
}
```

### DAO Governance
Decentralized autonomous organization:
```json
{
  "governanceModel": {
    "type": "dao",
    "participants": ["did:dao:governance-token-holders"],
    "policyDocument": "https://governance.dao/policies"
  }
}
```

### Committee Governance
Multi-stakeholder committee:
```json
{
  "governanceModel": {
    "type": "committee", 
    "participants": [
      "did:web:stakeholder1.org",
      "did:web:stakeholder2.org",
      "did:web:stakeholder3.org"
    ],
    "policyDocument": "https://committee.org/governance"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Root Authorities

1. **Define Clear Scope**: Specify exactly what domain or concept your root governs
2. **Establish Governance**: Choose appropriate governance model for your use case
3. **Set Delegation Policies**: Define how and to whom you'll delegate authority
4. **Plan Interoperability**: Consider which other roots you want to recognize
5. **Implement Revocation**: Establish clear revocation criteria and processes

### For Trusted Issuers

1. **Verify Chain of Trust**: Ensure your accrediting authority is legitimate
2. **Follow Operational Requirements**: Comply with technical and policy standards
3. **Maintain Metrics**: Track trust scores and operational metrics
4. **Report Regularly**: Fulfill reporting obligations to delegating authority
5. **Plan for Revocation**: Understand appeal processes and criteria

### For Verifiers

1. **Validate Full Chain**: Check credentials back to root authority
2. **Check Revocation Status**: Verify credentials haven't been revoked
3. **Respect Scope Limitations**: Only accept credentials within stated scope
4. **Cross-Reference Federations**: Consider federated root recognition
5. **Implement Caching**: Cache trust chain validations for performance

## Security Considerations

### Root Authority Security
- Strong cryptographic keys and secure key management
